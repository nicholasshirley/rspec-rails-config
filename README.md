# RSpec Config
This is the RSpec config that I use for all my Rails projects. The file names
are as you would find them in the Rails/RSpec directories, but with only the
relevant code inside them.

# Included configs
1. [rspec-rails](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails)
2. [Database Cleaner](https://github.com/DatabaseCleaner/database_cleaner)
3. [Shoulda Matchers](https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers)
4. [Faker](https://github.com/stympy/faker)
5. [factory_bot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot)
6. [WebMock](https://github.com/bblimke/webmock)

# Notes
All of the gems in the Gemfile are the latest versions. If that's
not what you want, make sure to specify.
